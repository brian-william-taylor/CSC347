A8: CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
========================================

A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim’s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the victim’s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application. This allows the attacker to force the victim’s browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim. 

Example under A8.html 

<img src="http://10.10.10.128/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=13&accountId=2" width="0" height="0" />


A6: SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE
========================================

Passwords need to be hashed and salted in order to be secure. The password database uses unsalted hashes to store everyone’s passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password file. All of the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of precalculated hashes.  

A site simply doesn’t use SSL for all authenticated pages. Attacker simply monitors network traffic (like an open wireless network), and steals the user’s session cookie. Attacker then replays this cookie and hijacks the user’s session, accessing the user’s private data. 

SSL needs to be activated in order to secure communications.

This can be achieved by adusting the httpd.conf file when using apache and installing certificates.
Following the link below will walk you through setting up ssl in order to secure communications.

A2: SESSION FIXATION
========================================

Application functions related to authentication and session management are often not implemented correctly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities.

See A2.png

Copying the cookie from the user in the firefox browser allowed me to access the users profile from the chrome browser.


A4: INSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCES
========================================

A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, or database key. Without an access control check or other protection, attackers can manipulate these references to access unauthorized data. 

Logged in as: 
Anne Lion where ID is 2. 

http://10.10.10.128/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=15&accountId=2

Change to a different ID in order to delete another users info.

http://10.10.10.128/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=15&accountId=8


A3: XSS
========================================

XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a web browser without proper validation or escaping. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites. 

Inserted " <a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/">This is a link</a> " into the form.
Output is a link. See A3.png



A1: SQL Injection
========================================

Injection flaws, such as SQL, OS, and LDAP injection occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.
