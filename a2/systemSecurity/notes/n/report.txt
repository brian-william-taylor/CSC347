Why:
By running:
diff /mnt/clean/var/log/secure /mnt/corr/var/log/secure
# and for all secure.# logs
we can see that the corrupted machine has had someone running the palindrome service using xinetd where the clean machine did not. 
Output Explaination: 
This is very important because it means that the machine is possbily compromised as a buffer overrun exploit is contained in palindrome. It is possible that the hacker gained physical access (or stole a copy of the VM), hacked the root password with john, signed in as root and started the palindrome service.


We also see that some tripwire logs have been updated.

Some of the boot logs have been wiped in the corrupted VM. Very suspicious!
