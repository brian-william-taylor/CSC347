Yes there is still exploits even if the attacker does not have access to the source code. An attacker could still experiment with
the user input to see what could be exploited. 

Something as simple as inputting %s a number of times in a single input string would cause the program to crash from the format string vulnerability. 
The program crashing would signal to the attacker that there exists a vulnerability here. 

An example of this would be inputting: %s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s 
The program would eventually hit a piece of memory that is not accessible causing a segmentation fault.
