Changes made for security:

The two major changes that were necessary from this:

    1. Limit a users input to be equal to the size of the buffer. This will prevent buffer overflows.

    2. Change printing the users input to print the input as a string. 
         i.e printf(s) -> printf('%s', s);
       This will prevent the format string explotation 


--------------------------------------------------------------------
                              ISSUE 1
Vulnerability: There is a format string explotation

Exploit a: Reading memory
Exploit b: Reading exact memory location
Exploit c: Altering memory with arbitrary data
Exploit d: Altering exact memory location with arbitrary data
Exploit e: Altering exact memory location with intentional data

                              ISSUE 2
Vulnerability: Possiblity of a buffer overflow of buffer s[1024]

Exploit a: Is is possible to overflow s to steal information from the program.

Exploit b: It is possible to overflow s an use it to overwrite the return address which could allow you to jump to malicious code.
