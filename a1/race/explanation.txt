Explain what the setuid bit means for race, when run by the hacker.

Setuid programs are a device to allow users to acquire new privileges for a limited amount of time. 
As such, they provide a means for overriding the protection scheme designed into UNIX.

What this means for the hacker is that the file is being run with root privileges even though the hacker does not have those permissions.
